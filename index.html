        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Jaszen Arriola, and I am an Economics major at the University of California Riverside. 
        I am passionate about data analysis, economics, and technology. 
        This all stemmed from my experience in high school. I was enrolled in the International Baccalaureate Program, which was a rigorouse program that focused on testing your skills and apptitude for learning. 
        The program focused on U.S. History, Mathematics and Business Administration. I conducted an extended research on the Great Depression, demonstrating advanced analytical and critical thinking skills. 
        Additionally, I was given the opportunity to participate in a stock market exchance simulation which gained me some practical insight into the financial markets.<br><br>

        My interest in data analysis began with the Spring Research Cohort for Omicron Delta Epsilon. 
        They are an international economics honor society with a summer program that focuses solely on data analysis and learning the programming language "R". 
        My team members and I were tasked with analyzing over a hundred thousand values, and I demonstrated leadership and collaborative efforts by evaluating large datasets involving college acceptances, GPAs, and so on.<br><br>
        
        In the summer of that year as well I had the opportunity of becoming a Public Health Inter for the City of Perris. 
        I collaborated with the Public Health team to oversee the Junior Masters Gardener program for students. 
        This was a summer program at which they had the chance to learn a lot about the environment, gardening and so on.
        Additionally, during my intern period I was tasked with analyzing and organizing purchase order forms and contracts for the Public Health office. As well, I was in charge of inquiring about a significant purchase involving the Gardening rebuilding project which exceeded $1000.
        I conducted administrative work as well and coordinated with the financial department to facilitate purchases for the Public Health team.<br><br>

        In my time in college, I had the chance as well to hone in on my focus and what I wanted to achieve. 
        I had taken a data analysis class which challenged us in doing a full analysis of our own with a dataset of our choosing which the duration of the project spanned more than half of the quarter. The coding software used was "R" and that allowed me to become even more profficient in the coding language.
        Additionally, I have participated in some club activities with Hylander Financial Group which then provided students with invaluable hands-on investment experience and different levels of financial expertise.
        Higlander Economics club was as well a club that I participated in and they supported students in creating study groups, finding necessary resources to succeed in UR and conncectng students with professors and employers.
